# Virtual Keyboard
Make your fingertips close to each other to type, instead of tapping physical keys. Based on the distance between your index fingertip and your middle fingertip, you can simply type via this virtual keyboard. This keyboard also can be used rather than your physical keyboard, in case you do not want your keystrokes to be tracked.

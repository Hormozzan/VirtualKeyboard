# Virtual Keyboard
This virtual keyboard helps you type without needing to press actual keys. It can also be helpful when you are concerned about your keystrokes being tracked. To press a key, simply place your fingertips close to each other. Based on the distance between your index fingertip and your middle fingertip, you can simply type on this virtual keyboard.

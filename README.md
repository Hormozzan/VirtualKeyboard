# VirtualKeyboard
Make your finger tips close to each other to type, instead of tapping physical keys. With respect to the distance between your index finger tip and your middle finger tip, you can simply type via this virtual keyboard. This keyboard also has this feature to be used rather than your physical keyboard, in case you do not want your keystrokes be tracked.

## Usage
First, install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, use `VirtualKeyboard.py` to use this keyboard for typing:
```
python VirtualKeyboard.py
```
